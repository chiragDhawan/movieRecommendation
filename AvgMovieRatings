##
#   Yes if the average rating is more than 3 and less than 5
##
#   No if the average rating is 2 or less than 2
##
#   Maybe if the average rating is more than 2 and less than 3

ratings<-read.csv(file.choose()) # This will open the ratings file  
movies<-read.csv(file.choose())  # This will open the movies file

ratingMatrix<-ratings%>%                    # Using the dplyr package's piping operater to arrange the movies according to movieId
  select(movieId,rating)%>%
  arrange(movieId)

## Here using the sqldf package to get the average rating grouped by the movie Id
AvgRating<-sqldf('select movieId, avg(rating) as averageRating from ratingMatrix group by movieId') # useful package to use sql queries on the table
