###### This file combines the 3 files of tags, genres and rates
#
##############

#Opening the three files 
tags<-read.csv(file.choose()) # This is the file tf-idf file with zeros added for the tags which did not have a tag associated with it
genres<-read.csv(file.choose())  #This is the file with genres seperated as columns
rates<-read.csv(file.choose()) #This is the average rating file

# We only use those movies which have a rating associated with it
gen<-genres[genres$movieId%in%rates$movieId,]  # getting only those rows for which the corresponding movie Id has an average Rating 
tags_fin<-tags[tags$movieId%in%rates$movieId,] # Similary for the tags
movieId<-rates$movieId

# Creating a final dataframe combining the seperated generes, seperated tags and average Rating
final<-data.frame(movieId,gen[,4:22],tags_fin[,2:45],rates[,2:3]) 

# the final table will consist of Watch column which will be our predictor variable
# We will do classification and predict whether a movie will have the Watch column as Yes, Maybe, No
