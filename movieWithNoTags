### This file gives value 0 to the tag columns for those movie IDs which did not have a tag associated with it
### and the tf idf matrix from previous file is combined with this matrix

#######################################
# un contains the unique movie Id's of the tags
un<-unique(tags$movieId)

# diff contains the movie Id's  of those movies not present in the tags file 
# As there are some movies which do not have a tag associated with them
diff<-movies$movieId[ !movies$movieId %in% un]

##################################
mid_tag<-sort(unique(tags$movieId)) ##get the unique movie Ids from the tags file and sort it then store it into a mid_tag variable

cher<-data.frame(movieId=mid_tag,dtm1) ## store the the dtm1 matrix obtained along with their respective movie Id and store as dataframe

######### rbind the movie Ids not present in the tags file i.e diff
####and giving their values as 0
m<-length(diff)
dtm2<-as.data.frame(dtm1)[m,]
cheri<-NULL
cheri<-data.frame(movieId=diff,dtm2) # creating a dataframe containing the diff movie Ids and giving the value 0
che<-rbind(cher,cheri) ## row binding cher and cheri

## Using the dplyr package to arrange the movieId in the che dataframe
che<-che%>%        
  arrange(movieId)

write.table(che, "D:/dataMining", sep=",")
